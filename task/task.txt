Test task
Need to create an application to view documents and add annotations on it.
Details

	1. User opens doc by link with id of the document
	2. The document downloaded from the server with pagination and scrolling is displayed
	to the user (the server is a mock-up, the json document format is arbitrary, the pages
	are linked)
	3. The document zoom is available to the user (+/-)
	4. The user can add an annotation (picture or inscription) to any page of the document
	5. For the added annotation, the following options are available: moving and deleting
	6. The save result button is available to the user. After saving, the application goes to another page and outputs json with the parameters of the added annotations (page,
	coordinates, size, content). To save time you can output the result to the console
	instead of creating a new page.

Nice to have
	1. Unit / e2e tests
	2. Extensible architecture (application state, adding other types of annotations)
	3. Resizing, rotation, opacity change for annotations
Expected result
	1. Source code on Github
	2. Screenshots of the project
	3. Readme with a description of the project in free form - a general approach, pros and
	cons of implementation, known issues and solutions.
